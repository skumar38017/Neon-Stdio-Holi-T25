Ticket System Infrastructure and Architecture Cost
Overview
We are designing a ticket system that enables users to fill out a form with details such as name, email, mobile number, and choice of ticket price. After form submission, the system will integrate with Razorpay for payment processing. Upon successful payment, the system generates a QR code and a hexadecimal ticket identifier. These details are sent to the customer’s mobile number.
The infrastructure leverages AWS services for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Below, we explain the technologies used and the reasoning behind each component.
Fill out a form with details such as name, email, mobile number, and ticket price choice.
Proceed to payment via Razorpay.
Generate a QR code and hexadecimal ticket ID upon successful payment.
Send the ticket details to the customer's mobile number.

Ticket System Infrastructure and Architecture
Overview
We are designing a ticket system that enables users to fill out a form with details such as name, email, mobile number, and choice of ticket price. After form submission, the system will integrate with Razorpay for payment processing. Upon successful payment, the system generates a QR code and a hexadecimal ticket identifier. These details are sent to the customer’s mobile number.
The infrastructure leverages AWS services for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Below, we explain the technologies used and the reasoning behind each component.

Document: Ticketing System Workflow
1. Overview
The ticketing system will allow users to purchase tickets by filling in a form, processing the payment via Razorpay, and receiving a ticket (including a QR code and a hexadecimal identifier) via SMS. The system uses AWS infrastructure for reliability and scalability.

2. Workflow
Step 1: User Form Submission
The user fills out the form with the following details:
Name
Email
Mobile Number
Ticket Price Selection
Step 2: Payment Processing
The system redirects the user to the Razorpay Payment Gateway.
After successful payment, Razorpay sends a webhook response to your backend confirming the transaction.
Step 3: Ticket Generation
Once the backend receives the successful payment confirmation:
Generate a unique hexadecimal ticket ID.
Create a QR code containing the ticket details (ticket ID, name, and ticket price).
Save the ticket information to the PostgreSQL RDS database.
Step 4: Ticket Delivery
Upload the QR code to S3 bucket for storage.
Send the ticket details (including the ticket ID and QR code link) to the user’s mobile number via SNS (SMS).
Step 5: Ticket Validation
Use WebSocket APIs to allow real-time ticket validation at the venue.
The ticket ID/QR code is scanned, and the backend verifies its validity against the database.

3. Detailed Flowchart
Here’s a simplified flowchart to visualize the workflow:

END


4. Infrastructure Architecture
The following AWS components work together to build a reliable and scalable system:
Frontend
Deployed on AWS EC2 instances behind a Load Balancer.
The form submission interacts with the backend through REST APIs.
Backend (FastAPI-based)
Runs asynchronously using:
Redis for caching and real-time data storage (e.g., form inputs).
RabbitMQ for message queuing.
Celery for background task processing (e.g., ticket generation).
Exposes APIs for:
Form submission
Payment processing
Ticket validation
Database
PostgreSQL (RDS) stores all ticket and user details securely.
Ensures data consistency and supports complex queries for reporting.
Payment Gateway
Razorpay is integrated with webhooks for real-time payment updates.
File Storage
QR codes are stored in S3 buckets for cost-effective and scalable storage.
CloudFront serves the QR code links for low-latency delivery.
SMS Notifications
AWS SNS sends ticket details to the user’s mobile number after successful payment.
DNS and Routing
Route 53 manages the domain and routing to the load balancer.
CloudFront provides secure and fast content delivery.
Monitoring
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor logs and performance metrics.

5. Suggested Improvements
1. Optimize Real-Time Validation
Use WebSocket connections for live ticket validation, ensuring real-time responses at the venue.
2. Enhance Scalability
Use auto-scaling groups for EC2 instances to handle high traffic.
3. Add Email Notifications
In addition to SMS, send ticket details via email using SES (Simple Email Service).
4. Enhance Security
Implement a WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against malicious traffic.
Use IAM roles and policies to limit access to AWS resources.
5. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Enable automatic backups for PostgreSQL RDS.
Replicate S3 data to another region using cross-region replication.

6. How It All Works Together
Frontend Interaction:
The user interacts with a frontend hosted on EC2 instances. The load balancer ensures even traffic distribution.
Backend Processing:
The backend handles user requests asynchronously with FastAPI. It uses Redis for temporary storage, RabbitMQ for message queuing, and Celery for background tasks.
Payment Gateway:
Razorpay manages the payment flow. Upon payment completion, it sends a webhook to the backend for confirmation.
Ticket Generation:
The backend generates a ticket (hexadecimal ID + QR code) and saves it to RDS and S3. Celery processes these tasks in the background to keep the user-facing APIs responsive.
Ticket Delivery:
The ticket details are sent to the user via SNS (SMS) with a link to the QR code hosted on CloudFront.
Ticket Validation:
The QR code is scanned at the venue, and the backend verifies its validity using WebSocket APIs.
